Explain the entire java life cycle.
Answer: We write our code in source file which ends with .java. Java compiler compile the code from source file and convert it to Bytecode file. Then the Bytecode convert into Java virtual machine.
class loader receives the Bytecode and send it to Bytecode verifier. Bytecode verifier check if there is any issue with the code and send off to the Interpreter.

Answer: final : final is the keyword and access modifier which is used to apply restrictions on a class, method or variable.
        finally : finally is the block in Java Exception Handling to execute the important code weather the exception occurs or not.
        finalize : finalize is the method in Java which is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collection.

What is a constructor?
Answer: The constructor's sole purpose is to initialize the object of the class. Constructor is implicit to all classes, each class has its own constructor,
Wheather explicitly declared, or not.
